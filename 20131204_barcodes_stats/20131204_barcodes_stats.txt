here is a fancy plot, and the corresponding table. The plot shows the proportion of barcodes in relation to all barcodes where at least one of the two halves have been found perfectly (e.g. for all experiments in roughly 80% of cases where one half of the barcode has been perfectly matched, the other half is there as well). 

The table gives the corresponding number. One.half.good is the number of reads where the detected barcode contains at least one half-barcode perfectly matched, I used this number to normalise the other counts (e.g. if you want to get the number of perfectly matched barcodes, multiply the fraction with that count).  Perfect.match is the proportion of barcodes that fit perfectly with the barcode sequence, single.nucleotide.mismatch is the proportion of barcodes with only one mismatch that is not the N in thirdd position, these are in the n.in.third column, and finally barcode.swaps is the propotion of the ones where one half of the barcode corresponds to an oter half-barcode.
